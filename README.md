# KatanaModel
This is a 3D model I made alongside an international student as a mentoring exercise.

I worked in Discord via screen share with my student.

The files in this project are
1. The reference image we used for the model
2. The .blend file
3. The .fbx file
4. A screenshot of both finished models on each of our computers.

Thanks for checking out this project!
